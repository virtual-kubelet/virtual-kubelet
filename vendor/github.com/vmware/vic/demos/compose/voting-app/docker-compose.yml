# Postgres container will create an anonymous volume.  VIC will use a
# vmdk for the volume.  Since it is a new volume, it will have a lost+found
# folder, and the Postgres init scripts do not like a non-empty folder (the
# lost+found folder).  We work around this by directing the init scripts to
# use another arbitrary folder.  We do this by setting the PGDATA env var.
