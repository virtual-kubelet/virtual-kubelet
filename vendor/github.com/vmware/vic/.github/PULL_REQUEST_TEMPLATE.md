To trigger a custom build with this PR, include one of these in the PR's body:
- To skip running tests (e.g. for a work-in-progress PR), add `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]`
to the commit message or the PR title.
- To run the full test suite, use `[full ci]`.
- To run _one_ integration test or group, use `[specific ci=$test]`. Examples:
  - To run the `1-01-Docker-Info` suite: `[specific ci=1-01-Docker-Info]`
  - To run all suites under the `Group1-Docker-Commands` group: `[specific ci=Group1-Docker-Commands]`

- To fail fast (make normal failures fatal) during the integration testing, use `[fast fail]`.
