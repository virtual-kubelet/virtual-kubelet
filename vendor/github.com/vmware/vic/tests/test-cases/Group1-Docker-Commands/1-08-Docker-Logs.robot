Docker logs follow shutdown
    # Test that logs --follow reads all data following a close (shutdown) event.

    # - The container VM shutdown event happens while the (HTTP) log follow poller is asleep.
    # - The container VM log accumulates > interaction layer buffer size data while log follow poller was alseep.
    # Note that the interaction layer currently uses an extra super tiny buffer size of 64 bytes.
