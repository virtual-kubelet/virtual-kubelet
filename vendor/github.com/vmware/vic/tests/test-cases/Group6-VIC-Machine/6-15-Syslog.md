Test 6-15 - Verify vic-machine syslog-address
=======

# Purpose:
Verify remote syslog for VCH

# References:
* vic-machine-linux create -h

# Environment:
This test requires that a vSphere server is running and available
This test requires that a syslog server is running and available

# Test Steps
1. Deploy VIC appliance with debug logs enabled, and syslog server specified
2. Enable SSH on VIC appliance
3. Open SSH connection to VIC appliance
4. Get PIDs of running VIC daemons on VIC appliance
5. Open SSH connection to syslog server
6. Get contents of syslog file from syslog server
7. Verify syslog messages from all daemons exist on the syslog server
8. Run docker ps -a
9. Get contents of syslog file from syslog server
10. Verify messages generated by docker ps -a are on the syslog server
11. Run a variety of docker commands
12. Get contents of syslog file from syslog server

# Expected Outcome
* Step 6 output should have messages of the form <proc-name>[<proc-pid>] for docker-engine-server, port-layer-server, vic-init, and vicadmin
* Step 9 output should contain output of the form docker-engine-server[<docker-engine-server-pid>]: Calling GET /v1.25/containers/json?all=1
* Step 12 output should contain the output of the variety of docker commands
